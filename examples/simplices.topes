-- | The strict interval cube (see RS17 Section 3.1).
cube TWO with
  point Zero    -- ^ Zero point (left point).
  point One     -- ^ One point (right point).

-- | Inequality tope for the strict interval cube.
-- Here axioms are formulated in sequent calculus form.
-- TODO: verify whether rules have to be adjusted to allow cut-free proofs.
